## Troubleshooting
- **401 Authentication Error:**
  - Double-check your API key (no spaces, correct key).
  - Make sure your OpenRouter account is active and has model access.
- **LLM Fallback Warning:**
  - If you see a warning about the LLM not generating the document, your API key is invalid or the LLM is unavailable.
  - Try a new session and re-enter your key.
- **No document shown:**
  - Only LLM-generated documents are displayed. If the LLM fails, you will see a warning instead.
